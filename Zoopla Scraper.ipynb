It's a lovely, clean and confortable flat near the Sea, super close to the bus stops that takes you to all parts of Edinburgh, close to 3 supermarkets, Swimming Centre/ Gym, Restaurants and Bistros, lovely Coffe Shops, Library, Hair Dressers (all within one to two blocks from our flat), very quite stairs and our street is located in between the Sea and Portobello High Street (all buses take 15 mins to the City Centre). It is a family flat, I have only one son who is 8 years old called Leandro who is a very busy boy with lots of after school activities and he stays away with his dad twice a week during the week. His dad looks after him twice a week during the week at home, but they are super fun and quite busy with homework and projects. Our ideal flatmate is a professional person, who is a non-smoker, warm, kind, good at house keeping and who needs a lovely and cosy room to rest after work from Monday to Friday. I am a Pilates Professional and I run my own Pilates Studio which is also close to our flat (two blocks away). Therefore, if Pilates is your type of physical activity then there will be plenty Pilates sessions for you to choose from to take up after work during the week. I can provide fresh Bed Linnen (fortnightly) and fresh towels every week. All bills are included in the monthly rental fee. If you fit in with this type of accommodation and location then Leandro and I will be very much looking forward to welcoming you to Edinburgh/Portobello. Thank you very much. Sabrina & Leandro. :-) \",\n",
