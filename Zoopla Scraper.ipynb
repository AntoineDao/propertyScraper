       "  'description': \" Double, cosy attic bedroom available in a warm, spacious, well-maintained Victorian house, with real wooden polished floorboards and double-glazing throughout.  The bedroom has a double bed, wardrobe, a bedside cabinet and a chest of drawers. The room is in an attic conversion, which means nice and warm in the winter and bright and airy in the summer!  The bathroom is tiled with a powerful electric shower. There is a separate toilet.  The double kitchen comes fully equipped with a cooker, huge fridge-freezer, washing machine and microwave (and all the expected pots and pans). There is lots of storage.  There is a separate living room which has a flat-screen TV, a DVD player, Virgin Media TV and broadband and some huge, comfy aubergine-coloured soft leather settees.  There is a private garden with a big barbecue and some garden furniture, and we sometimes eat our dinner out in it in the summer.  The neighbourhood is a safe one, albeit fairly urban, as the shops on Green Lanes are pretty much 24 hours.  12 mins walk from Manor House tube (or 4 min by bus). Buses 29, N29, 141 and 341 and N341 all 1 mins walk away. W5 very nearby too which takes you all the way from Sainsbury's through Crouch End to Highgate.  We are 7 mins walk away from retail park which includes a 24-hour Sainsbury, MacDonalds, Superdrug, Argos, Next and Fitness First. The ethnic food stores of Green Lanes 7 mins away. 24 hour alcohol serving shops 1 min away which can be useful (although we aren't huge party animals)... Finsbury Park is only 7 mins away where you can take part in running clubs and military fitness (if you are mad).  £620 inc all bills except for energy which works out at £20-25 a month. Included in the rent is superfast fibre-optic wireless broadband, water and council tax.  We are looking for the right flatmate, who is friendly, up for a laugh, sociable and considerate. We are two females and two males aged 25 - 30 working in architecture, education, retail and advertising. We are friendly and sociable (though we don't completely live in each other's pockets!) and want someone who will fit in with the vibe of the house. Things we do together, and are partial to watching films and rubbish TV over a glass of wine and sometimes we cook together on a Sunday. Ideally we want someone who is up for some socialising that rather than someone who sits in their room all the time!  We like to keep the communal areas free from clutter and appreciate keeping the bathroom and kitchen nice and clean. We also recycle.  If this sounds good to you, please do get in touch! \",\n",

We are 3 mins walk from High Barnet tube, round the corner from Barnet Everyman and a nice 5-10minute walk from Barnet's cute town centre with a great fresh fruit and veg market on Wed and Sat morning.  The room is £700pcm for one person. This is inclusive of all bills.  Our house rules are simple: hygiene, security and respect for each other makes this a warm and comfortable home. We are vegan so invite fellow vegans to apply to see the space, meet us and check out whether living together could work. We all work so other young professionals or students could be a good fit. Yoga instructors will get extra points at interview :)  You would have access to a shared bathroom and shared kitchen and garden.  We actually have another room available too so if you and your mate are both looking for a space, this could work.  I'm happy to chat on 07732809583 or Skype initially before setting up a viewing.
