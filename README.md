# propertyScraper
Python module to demonstrate how to scrape property listing websites. All for the sake of learning of course.

## Under development

The basic functionality of the package have been set and one can now succesfully scrape from Gumtree, RightMove and Zoopla although I would not reccomend doing so as this would breach their Terms of Use. Consider these as examples to demonstrate how to go about getting data from html files using BeautifulSoup.
